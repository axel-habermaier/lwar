Client
========

- Handle ray and circle update messages
- Render all entity types
- Refactor entity system (component-oriented/data parallel/object-oriented entity system hybrid)
- Bug: Log.Die(), for instance in Ship.Draw, does not terminate the application.

Platform/Assets
========
- C# to HLSL/GLSL cross compiler
- Convert shaders to C#
- Manage all assets in a Visual Studio project, compiling them automatically when the solution is compiled
- Fully support render targets with color and depth/stencil buffers
- Remove dependency on SharpDX and invoke fxc.exe from the command line to compile HLSL shaders
- DirectX: Construct the shader input layout from the C# shader code instead of using build-time shader reflection
- Implement asset compression (store all assets as a single .zip-file maybe, giving higher priority to files on the filesystem such as Quake?)

Server
========
- server: slots need relative placement wrt ship,
          extend entity type struct for this
- server/Client: entity types, possible weapons, slots
