Client
========
- Effects
	- Improve planet rendering
	- Nebulae
	- Improve shield effect
	- Weapon effects
	- Particle system
	- Move skybox
- Entity interpolation
	- Reusable interpolation class?
- UI
	- Ship/Weapon selection
	- Minimap
	- Menus
		* Main menu
		* Server browser
		* Configuration (graphics settings, input settings, ...)
- Camera zoom bug in very-low FPS situations
- Multiple player names might overlap
- Let camera follow ship (sort of: attach the camera to the ship with a spring)
- Show server network statistics
- Collect and show client network statistics (avg number of times a reliable message was sent/received, # of incoming packets per second, etc.)
- Add layered networking system with debugging capabilities and statistics

Pegasus.Framework
========
- Show platform statistics, add 'level of detail' to show_stats cvar
- Track fullscreen resolution changes and add standard timeout-and-reset functionality for invalid resolutions
- Add .NET wrapper for Platform socket abstraction

Pegasus.Platform
========
- Linux: Fullscreen not implemented
- Statistics: # of draw calls, # of (redundant) state changes, # of textures, etc.
- Add UDP socket abstraction

Assets Compiler
========
- Asset compression
	- Store all assets in one or more .zip-files (decreases asset file size by about 50%)
	- Give higher priorities to files on the filesystem (similar to Quake 3)
- Fix constant buffer packing
- Organize assets into different packages
	- All assets of a package are loaded at the same time
	- Assign offsets per asset per package and use that instead of name at runtime

Network
========
- Should collision messages be reliable? Otherwise the client has to filter collision messages...

Server
========
- respawn: maybe just after some click?
- slots need relative placement wrt ship,
  extend entity type struct for this
- server: copy string to player, free memory
- figure out how to communicate ammount of ammunition
- Check assertion problem in player.c:85
- Fix infinite ship duplication bug (occurs reliably)
- BUG: If the mouse is directly in the center of the ship, the ship no longer reacts to mouse commands and 
  pressing a move key moves the ship into the sun
- BUG: assert(p->a <= p->b); packet.c:39
- BUG: assert(!e->dead); entity.c:177 (occurs, for instance, when flying into the world border)
- BUG: Long chat message (~ 250 characters) are ignored and not acknowledged by server
