Assets Compiler
========
- Storing cubemaps as 6 separate images might improve compilation times noticably
- Asset compression
	- Store all assets in one or more .zip-files
	- Give higher priorities to files on the filesystem (similar to Quake 3)

Network
========
- Send network spec revision number with Connect message, send WrongVersion message on version mismatch
- Are all reliable messages sent multiple times before there's even a chance to acknowledge them? Is that a problem?

Server
========
- slots need relative placement wrt ship,
  extend entity type struct for this
- server/client: entity types, possible weapons, slots
- server_init: static initialization of struct Server, check for other problems.
  e.g. gen is not reset (should be okay)
- server: copy string to player, free memory
- !!!!!!!!!players can kill each other
- !!mouse aim bug
- !!phaser follows mouse
- !!bullet time to live
- !Level Design
- !!Level boundaries
- fix repeated spawn bug in visualization on 'E'
- figure out how to communicate ammount of ammunition
