Client
========
- Effects
	- Improve planet rendering
	- Nebulae
	- Improve shield effect
	- Weapon effects
	- Particle system
	- Move skybox
- Entity interpolation
	- Reusable interpolation class?
- UI
	- Ship/Weapon selection
	- Minimap
	- Menus
		* Main menu
		* Server browser
		* Configuration (graphics settings, input settings, ...)
- Camera zoom bug in very-low FPS situations
- Multiple player names might overlap
- Let camera follow ship (sort of: attach the camera to the ship with a spring)
- Show server network statistics
- Collect and show client network statistics (avg number of times a reliable message was sent/received, # of incoming packets per second, etc.)
- Welcome text not centered when leaving fullscreen with non-native resolution

Pegasus.Framework
========
- Show platform statistics, add 'level of detail' to show_stats cvar
- Track fullscreen resolution changes and add standard timeout-and-reset functionality for invalid resolutions
- Console scrolling with mouse wheel
- Crash when deleting characters
- Crash when spamming

Pegasus.Platform
========
- Linux: Enforce minimum/maximum allowed window size (use XSetWMNormalHints)
- Linux: Double clicking not implemented
- Linux: Fullscreen not implemented, moving and resizing window mostly not working
- Linux: Input bug (for instance, crash when entering text into the console; dead key problem -> use previously used deprecated function?)
- Statistics: # of draw calls, # of (redundant) state changes, # of textures, etc.
- Get rid of EXT_direct_state_access
- Fix AMD OpenGL synchronization bug

Assets Compiler
========
- Storing cubemaps as 6 separate images might improve compilation times noticably
- Add dependency system (e.g., cubemap depends on 6 textures, font depends on texture)
- Asset compression
	- Store all assets in one or more .zip-files
	- Give higher priorities to files on the filesystem (similar to Quake 3)
- Fix constant buffer packing

Network
========
- Should collision messages be reliable? Otherwise the client has to filter collision messages...

Server
========
- collisions with planets and intersection of entities should destroy them
- Level boundaries
- !!respawn: maybe just after some click?
- slots need relative placement wrt ship,
  extend entity type struct for this
- server: copy string to player, free memory
- figure out how to communicate ammount of ammunition
- Check assertion problem in player.c:85
- Fix infinite ship duplication bug (might be a client issue?)
- BUG: If the mouse is directly in the center of the ship, the ship no longer reacts to mouse commands and 
  pressing a move key moves the ship into the sun
- BUG: assert(p->a <= p->b); packet.c:39
- BUG: assert(!e->dead); entity.c:177
- Infinite ship spawn bug occurs reliably
