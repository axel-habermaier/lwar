Client
========
- Effects
	- Improve planet rendering
	- Nebulae
	- Improve shield effect
	- Weapon effects
	- Particle system
	- Move skybox
- Entity interpolation
	- Reusable interpolation class?
- UI
	- Ship/Weapon selection
	- Minimap
	- Menus
		* Main menu
		* Server browser
		* Configuration (graphics settings, input settings, ...)
- Camera zoom bug in very-low FPS situations
- Multiple player names might overlap
- Let camera follow ship (sort of: attach the camera to the ship with a spring)
- Show server network statistics
- Collect and show client network statistics (avg number of times a reliable message was sent/received, # of incoming packets per second, etc.)

Pegasus.Framework
========
- Show platform statistics, add 'level of detail' to show_stats cvar
- Fully implement emoticon support
- Track fullscreen resolution changes and add standard timeout-and-reset functionality for invalid resolutions
- Key down/up in the same frame, multiple key down/ups in same frame
- Persist key bindings
- Store autoexec.cfg and log in other directory

Pegasus.Platform
========
- Linux: Enforce minimum/maximum allowed window size
- Linux: Double clicking not implemented
- Linux: Fullscreen not implemented, moving and resizing window mostly not working
- Linux: Input bug (for instance, crash when entering text into the console)
- Statistics: # of draw calls, # of (redundant) state changes, # of textures, etc.
- Bug: Window is not opened in maximized mode when native debugging is not enabled??

Assets Compiler
========
- Storing cubemaps as 6 separate images might improve compilation times noticably
- Asset compression
	- Store all assets in one or more .zip-files
	- Give higher priorities to files on the filesystem (similar to Quake 3)
- Allow shader constants initialization for vector types (e.g., = new Vector2(1,1))

Network
========
- Send network spec revision number with Connect message, send WrongVersion message on version mismatch
- Are all reliable messages sent multiple times before there's even a chance to acknowledge them? Is that a problem?
  Comment: queue.c last_tx_time and RETRANSMIT_INTERVAL capture this, see qm_check_relevant
- Should collision messages be reliable? Otherwise the client has to filter collision messages...

Server
========
- !!mouse aim bug
- !!collisions with planets and intersection of entities should destroy them
- !!Level boundaries
- !!respawn: maybe just after some click?
- !!strafing
- !Level Design
- slots need relative placement wrt ship,
  extend entity type struct for this
- server: copy string to player, free memory
- figure out how to communicate ammount of ammunition
- Check assertion problem in player.c:85
- Fix infinite ship duplication bug (might be a client issue?)
