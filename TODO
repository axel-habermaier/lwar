Pegasus
========
- Implement asset compression (store all assets as a single .zip-file maybe, giving higher priority to files on the filesystem such as Quake?)
- Linux: Fullscreen mode does not work reliably
- Linux: Set minimum/maximum allowed window size
- Linux: Window key/button event handling
- Linux: Alt+Tab and fullscreen?
- Windows: Alt+Tab out of fullscreen game not behaving nicely
- Persist window maximized/minimized state
- Statistics: # of draw calls, # of (redundant) state changes, # of textures, etc.
- Move some input state handling to Platform lib
- Allow font color specifiers within texts (e.g., ^r to switch to red)
- Allow emoticons within texts
- Fix: Closing the console while the chat input open enters a ` character into the chat input
