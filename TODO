	- Prefix all shader-code variables with _ to avoid name clashes with reserved HLSL/GLSL keywords/built-in vars/intrinsics
	- Verify that no variable with name ConstantBufferX and BindGraphicsObjects is declared
	- Implement Expose() attribute (and check for name clashes)
- Implement asset compression (store all assets as a single .zip-file maybe, giving higher priority to files on the filesystem such as Quake?)

	- Persist cvars in config file
	- System cvars (read-only)
