Pegasus.Framework
========
- Show platform statistics, add 'level of detail' to show_stats cvar
- Fully implement emoticon support
- Track fullscreen resolution changes and add standard timeout-and-reset functionality for invalid resolutions
- key down/up in the same frame, multiple key down/ups in same frame

Pegasus.Platform
========
- Linux: Enforce minimum/maximum allowed window size
- Linux: Double clicking not implemented
- Linux: Fullscreen not implemented, moving and resizing window mostly not working
- Statistics: # of draw calls, # of (redundant) state changes, # of textures, etc.
  also define a name of the type

Assets Compiler
========
- Storing cubemaps as 6 separate images might improve compilation times noticably
- Asset compression
	- Store all assets in one or more .zip-files
	- Give higher priorities to files on the filesystem (similar to Quake 3)

Network
========
- Send network spec revision number with Connect message, send WrongVersion message on version mismatch
- Are all reliable messages sent multiple times before there's even a chance to acknowledge them? Is that a problem?
  Comment: queue.c last_tx_time and RETRANSMIT_INTERVAL capture this, see qm_check_relevant

Server
========
- !!mouse aim bug
- !!collisions with planets and intersection of entities should destroy them
- !!Level boundaries
- !!respawn: maybe just after some click?
- !!strafing
- !Level Design
- slots need relative placement wrt ship,
  extend entity type struct for this
- server: copy string to player, free memory
- figure out how to communicate ammount of ammunition
