Gameplay Ideas
=====================

- Let user choose a shield color (maybe 6 to 8 presets)
- Give ships weapons energy that, when depleted, prevents further weapon firing
  (forces player to stop shooting all the time)
- Split ship health into shield energy and hull integrity, some weapons do more
  damage to one or the other
  (allows more variation in ship design and more tactical weapons selection;
  shield energy regenerates over time)
- Restrict ammunition of certain weapons (notably: rockets)
- Add nebulae that have negative or positive effects when flying through
  (i.e.: damage ship, drain/reload shields, drain/reload weapon energy, ...)
- Invisible mines
- BLACK HOLES! (time dilation)
- Asteroidz
- Power Ups
- EMP (deactivates shields and propulsions)
- AI controlled aliens - they kill everyone
- Alien motherships - instant death
- Tractor beam
