Gameplay Ideas
=====================

- Warp drive: Allows ship to move at higher speed; shields are down while in warp (hits by enemy fire deal greater damage);
  controllability of ship decreases; crashes into planets or other ships are deadly
- Give ships weapons energy that, when depleted, prevents further weapon firing
  (forces player to stop shooting all the time)
- Split ship health into shield energy and hull integrity, some weapons do more
  damage to one or the other
  (allows more variation in ship design and more tactical weapons selection;
  shield energy regenerates over time)
- Restrict ammunition of certain weapons (notably: rockets)
- Add nebulae that have negative or positive effects when flying through
  (i.e.: damage ship, drain/reload shields, drain/reload weapon energy, ...)
- (Invisible) mines
- BLACK HOLES! (time dilation)
- Asteroidz
- Power Ups (QUAD DAMAGE!, Speed, Invisibility, Invincibility, Infinite Ammo/Energy, Shield Recharge Boost, Hull Integrity Boost)
- EMP (deactivates shields and propulsions)
- AI controlled aliens - they kill everyone
- Alien motherships - instant death
- Tractor beam
- Moons that orbit planets
- Winning condition: Most frags
- Game modes: Team Deathmatch, Tower Defense with objective "defend inhabited planet from AI controlled alien destroyers" (stationary defenses?)
- Achievements, i.e. like in Unreal Tournament
	* By fast fragging: These are achieved by killing as many players as possible, at a fast pace. 
	  The reward level is reset, if the kill isn't made fast enough, or you get killed.
        - Double Kill: When you kill two enemy bots quickly enough, or at a time
        - Multi Kill: When you kill three enemy bots
        - Ultra Kill: When you kill four bots
        - MONSTER KILL!!!: When you kill five enemy bots.
        - LUDICROUS KILL!!!: When you kill six enemy bots
        - HOLY SHIT!: When you kill more than six enemy bots. The announcement is made after every fast-kill from here. 

    * By fragging without getting killed in the middle: These are achieved by killing a certain number of enemies
	  without you getting killed in the fragging process. The reward level is reset if you get killed.
        - Killing Spree: You kill 5 enemy bots without yourself getting killed
        - Rampage: You kill 10 enemy bots
        - Dominating: You kill 15 enemy bots
        - Unstoppable: You kill 20 enemy bots
        - Godlike: You kill 25 enemy bots
