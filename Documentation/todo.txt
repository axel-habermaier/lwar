Client
========
- Effects
	- Improve planet rendering
	- Nebulae
	- Improve shield effect
	- Weapon effects
	- Move skybox
- Entity network synchronization
	- Entity interpolation
	- Ignore new entities until at least one update message has been received
    - Check whether to keep assumption that packets contain at least one message
- UI
	- Ship/Weapon selection
	- Minimap
	- Menus
		* Server browser
		* Configuration (graphics settings, input settings, ...)
		* Menu transitions
- GameCamera
	- Let camera follow ship (sort of: attach the camera to the ship with a spring)
- Add debugging capabilities and statistics to network
	- Show server network statistics
	- Collect and show client network statistics (avg number of times a reliable message was sent/received, # of incoming packets per second, etc.)
- Fix respawn screen being displayed for a couple of frames after the player joined a new game session
- NRE in Client.MessageHandler.OnShipUpdated
- Support Linux debug builds

Pegasus
========
- Add texture quality switch cvar -> asset reloading required
- Add particle System
- UI
	* Implement controls: Combobox, Checkbox, Image
	* Implement animation system
	* Add to TextBox: Text selection (both via mouse and keyboard), copy & paste
	* Add to SrollViewer: Horizontal scrolling, scrollbars
	* Add to Button: hover/click feedback
- write C# analyzer that checks whether PooledObjects are not constructed directly
- write C# analyzer that checks whether all fields of PooledObjects are reset
- Can't write IL project output

Platform
========
- fix clang/gcc build warnings

Assets Compiler
========
- Compile 3D models (using ASSIMP: http://assimp.sourceforge.net/, https://code.google.com/p/assimp-net/)
- Make Xaml compiler more robust with better error reporting

Network
========
- Order of players in stats message should determine their rank (at the moment, the client ranks them)
- Add reliable GameEnd message with reason Victory/Tie/GalaxyChange (client can automatically determine (tied) winners
  based on player ranks); should contain next galaxy name (so that client can show it and load the data)
- Add reliable achievement message (see ideas.txt)
- Remove seqno from unreliable messages header; instead, add frameNumber (or frameTime) to packet header (use the same
  value for all packets sent during the same frame) that is used by unreliable messages instead
- Server should send Disconnect message (or serveral ones) when it shuts down to all clients (the clients can then end
  the game session, instead of timing out)

Server
========
- slots need relative placement wrt ship,
  extend entity type struct for this
- server: copy string to player, free memory
- figure out how to communicate amount of ammunition
- BUG: assert(p->a <= p->b); packet.c:39 (?)
       assert(ship); rules.c:178
- For an environmental kill, server sends a killer id of 0 with random generation in release builds on Windows (without attached debugger);
  does not happen in release builds with debugger attached or in any debug builds -> probably some uninitialized variable
  Network spec rev 23 requires the generation of reserved ids to be 0 in all cases
