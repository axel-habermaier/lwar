Client
========
- Effects
	- Improve planet rendering
	- Nebulae
	- Improve shield effect
	- Weapon effects
	- Move skybox
- Entity network synchronization
	- Entity interpolation
	- Ignore new entities until at least one update message has been received
- UI
	- Ship/Weapon selection
	- Minimap
	- Menus
		* Server browser
		* Configuration (graphics settings, input settings, ...)
		* Menu transitions
- GameCamera
	- Camera zoom bug in very-low FPS situations
	- Camera zoom bug: zooming when dead leads to strange camera behavior when respawning
	- Let camera follow ship (sort of: attach the camera to the ship with a spring)
- Add debugging capabilities and statistics to network
	- Show server network statistics
	- Collect and show client network statistics (avg number of times a reliable message was sent/received, # of incoming packets per second, etc.)
- Fix respawn screen being displayed for a couple of frames after the player joined a new game session

Pegasus.Framework
========
- Add texture quality switch cvar -> asset reloading required
- Add particle System
- UI
	* Implement controls: Combobox, Checkbox, Image
	* Implement animation system
	* Add to TextBox: Text selection (both via mouse and keyboard), copy & paste
	* Add to SrollViewer: Horizontal scrolling, scrollbars
	* Add to Button: hover/click feedback

Pegasus.Platform
========

Assets Compiler
========
- Asset compression
	- Store all assets in one or more .zip-files (decreases asset file size by about 50%)
	- Give higher priorities to files on the filesystem (similar to Quake 3)
- Organize assets into different packages
	- All assets of a package are loaded at the same time
	- Assign offsets per asset per package and use that instead of name at runtime
- Compile 3D models (using ASSIMP: http://assimp.sourceforge.net/, https://code.google.com/p/assimp-net/)
- Make Xaml compiler more robust with better error reporting

Network
========

Server
========
- slots need relative placement wrt ship,
  extend entity type struct for this
- server: copy string to player, free memory
- figure out how to communicate amount of ammunition
- BUG: assert(p->a <= p->b); packet.c:39 (?)
       assert(ship); rules.c:178
